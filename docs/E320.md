# Setup Schematic


# Step 1. Initial Setup

## Management Interface

To check if the device is recognized by UHD, run one of the following commands

    UHD_IMAGES_DIR=/usr/share/uhd/images/ uhd_find_devices
    UHD_IMAGES_DIR=/usr/share/uhd/images/ /usr/local/bin/uhd_find_devices
    
If the device is not showing up, check the network interfaces and bring them up, or just simply turn on the radios LoL.

Connect to the device over USB

    ls /dev/serial/by-id
    
Every E320 series device connected to USB will by default show up as four different devices. The devices labeled `USB_to_UART_Bridge_Controller` are the devices that offer a serial prompt. The first (with the `if00` suffix) connects to the STM32 Microcontroller, whereas the second connects to the ARM CPU.
    
    sudo screen  /dev/serial/by-id/usb-Silicon_Labs_CP2105_Dual_USB_to_UART_Bridge_Controller_011C1095-if01-port0 115200

Enter `root` for the login and empty password.

To setup the radio network interfaces, edit these files:

    vim /etc/systemd/network/eth0.network
    vim /etc/systemd/network/sfp0.network
    
NOTE: Care needs to be taken when editing these files on the device, since `vi` / `vim` sometimes generates undo files (e.g. `/data/network/sfp0.network~`), that systemd-networkd might accidentally pick up.
    
For example, for the development devices, we set the `eth0` interface ip to:

    [Network]
    Address=192.168.2.3/16
    Gateway=192.168.0.1 

In the end, make sure the devices respond to ping and use ssh

    ssh root@192.168.2.3
    uhd_usrp_probe

For some reason, uhd commands do not work over screen and USB. Run them and confirm the UHD version matches the UHD version of the radio host.
